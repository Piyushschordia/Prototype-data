<p>The Meliadine mine in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut is Agnico Eagle’s second mine in Canada’s Low Arctic, opening nine years after the Meadowbank mine. Located near the western shore of Hudson Bay, about 25 km north of Rankin Inlet and 290 km southeast of our Meadowbank mine, Meliadine achieved commercial production in May 2019. The Company anticipates that, under current mine plans, mining at Meliadine will be carried out through several underground mining operations and open pits over a mine life extending to 2032. There are numerous opportunities to create additional value at Meliadine, both at the mine and on the large 80-kilometre regional land package.</p>
