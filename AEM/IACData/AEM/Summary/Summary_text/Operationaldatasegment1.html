<p>We recognize the close links between environmental stresses and health. This includes the many ways in which climate change affects human health, such as driving increases in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and accelerating the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria. According to the WHO, climate change impacts are already harming health through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, food insecurity and pressures on mental health. In fact, the WHO reports that every year, environmental factors take the lives of around 13 million people.</p>
<p>GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS: Regeneron continues to expand its disclosure across Scope 3 categories. Total emissions reflect sum of Scope 3 categories disclosed.</p>
<p>Historical Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market based) emissions intensity was revised for 2020 â€“ 2022 to account for updated square meters for our global operations.</p>
<p>Waste Management: In the 2022 inventory, T&D Grid loss was overstated for all Scope 2 electricity consumed at U.S. sites. The U.S. grid loss percentage of 5.3% was not applied to grid loss emissions resulting in an overstatement of T&D Grid Loss emissions for this category. Regeneron has restated this value in the 2023 inventory report in order to properly account for FERA emissions and track the growth of those emissions year-over-year.</p>
<p>Waste Diversion: Waste figures exclude construction and demolition waste.</p>
