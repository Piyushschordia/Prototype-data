<p>The Goldex complex is the easternmost part of the chain of operations and properties that Agnico Eagle owns in the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec and northern Ontario. Underground mining from the M and E satellite zones and processing in the mill started in September 2013. Commercial production was achieved in October 2013. The Deep 1 project declared commercial production in July 2017, extending the Goldex anticipated mine life through 2031 under current mine plans. The Akasaba West project, located 30 km from the Goldex mine, was approved for development in the second half of 2022 with commercial production expected to be achieved in the first quarter of 2024. Akasaba West is expected to provide additional production flexibility to the Goldex complex, contributing approximately 1,750 tonnes of ore per day to the Goldex processing facility, while the underground mine is now expected to contribute approximately 7,000 tonnes per day.</p?
