<p>The Canadian Malartic complex, located in the town of Malartic, 25 km west of Val-d’Or in northwestern Quebec, is the second-largest operating gold mine in Canada and one of the world’s largest gold mining operations. It is comprised of the Canadian Malartic open-pit mine and processing facility, and the Odyssey underground mine. The open-pit mine and processing plant built by Osisko Mining Corp. began commercial production in May 2011. In June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold acquired Osisko and created Canadian Malartic GP (“the Partnership”) to own and operate the mine with Agnico Eagle and Yamana each having a 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. The acquisition by Agnico Eagle of Yamana Gold's Canadian assets on March 31, 2023 resulted in the Company owning 100% of the Canadian Malartic Complex. Under the current mine plan, the Company expects the complex will be in production through 2042. </p>
