<p>The Meadowbank open-pit gold mine in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut — approximately 300 km west of Hudson Bay and 110 km by road north of Baker Lake — was Agnico Eagle’s first Low Arctic mine. It achieved commercial production in 2010 and mining operations continued until 2019. The development of the Amaruq open-pit and underground mine 50 km away has extended the life of the Meadowbank complex to 2028 by supplying a new source of ore to the existing Meadowbank mill. All ore at the Meadowbank complex is now sourced from the Amaruq deposit and is hauled by a long haul off-road fleet to the Meadowbank processing facility.</p>
