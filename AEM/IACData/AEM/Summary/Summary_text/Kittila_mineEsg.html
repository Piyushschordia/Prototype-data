<p>Located in the Lapland region of northern Finland, approximately 900 km north of Helsinki and 150 km north of the Arctic Circle, the Kittila mine is the largest primary gold producer in Europe. Kittila achieved commercial production on May 1, 2009, becoming Agnico Eagleâ€™s first mine outside of Canada. Since open-pit mining was completed in 2012, Kittila has been an underground-only operation.</p>
