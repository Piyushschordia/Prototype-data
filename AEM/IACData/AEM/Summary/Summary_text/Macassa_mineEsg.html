<p>The Macassa mine, located in the Town of Kirkland Lake, Ontario, remains one of the highest gold grade mines in the world. Since its initial discovery in the area in 1911, gold has been a staple in the town’s history. Between 1905 and 1935, a multitude of mines opened in the area that produced collectively more than 23 million ounces of gold in the 20th century.</p>
<p>The high-grade South Mine Complex (SMC) zone was discovered at Macassa in 2005 and resulted in significant grade improvement at the mine and an increase in production levels above historic averages.  In 2023, as part of the optimization efforts, the Company incorporated the sourcing of additional production from the Near Surface deposit at Macassa and the neighbouring Amalgamated Kirkland (AK) deposit to its production profile and guidance. Both of these areas are accessible from a shallow ramp at the Macassa mine.</p>
<p>Macassa was among the first mines globally to introduce battery-electric vehicles.</p>
